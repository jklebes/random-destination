# random-run-goal
Simply drops a pin N km from your location.  I use this for runs.

Command line / very simple / personal use

Usage:

```bash .\destination.sh <dist>```, 

prints out a link to an OpenStreetMap pin to terminal.

May well drop a pin in a body of water or somewhere else you can't go, just reroll.

Distances are as the crow flies, the actual distance along streets is longer.

TODO
- Future improvements to dostance could be to estimate the average factor or look at actual OpenStreetMap graphhopper path.
- Better parse inputted coordinates, address, or previously saved location.
